## 📥 Pull Request Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency, please follow these requirements for all Pull Requests:

### PR Format & Description
- **Title:** Use a concise title that describes the change (e.g., `feat: add Heap Sort visualization`).
- **Description:** 
  - Explain the **why** and **how** of your changes.
  - Link to the relevant issue (e.g., `Closes #123`).
  - Include screenshots or GIFs for any UI changes.
- **Scope:** Keep PRs focused. If you have multiple unrelated changes, please split them into separate PRs.

### Commit Message Conventions
We follow a simplified version of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` for new features.
- `fix:` for bug fixes.
- `docs:` for documentation changes.
- `style:` for formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change.
- `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `chore:` for updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

Example: `feat: implement Dijkstra animation logic`

## 🛠️ Development & Standards

### Code Style
- **JavaScript/React:** Follow the existing patterns. We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for consistency.
- **Formatting:** 2-space indentation, no semicolons, single quotes.
- **Components:** Prefer functional components with hooks.

### Test Expectations
- **Manual Verification:** Ensure the visualization works correctly across different input sizes and speeds.
- **Edge Cases:** Test your algorithm with empty inputs, large datasets, and unexpected user interactions.
- **Automated Tests:** While we are expanding our test suite, please ensure your changes do not break existing functionality by running `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.

### Review Timeline
- **Response Time:** We aim to respond to all issue assignment requests and PRs within **24-48 hours**.
- **Feedback Loop:** Be prepared to walk through your implementation or address comments before your PR is approved.
